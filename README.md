# **🚀 AI-Powered Task Allocation System – Solution Overview**  

## **1️⃣ Solution Approach**  

This project is an **AI-based task allocation system** that **automatically assigns tasks to employees** based on their **skills, workload, and availability**. The system ensures that tasks are **fairly distributed** and employees are matched with the best-fitting tasks using **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML)**.  

### **How It Works:**  
1. **Users Upload Data** 📂  
   - A **CSV file with tasks** (descriptions & required skills).  
   - A **CSV file with employees** (skills, availability, preferences).  

2. **AI Matches Tasks to Employees** 🤖  
   - Uses **BERT (a deep learning model)** to understand task descriptions & employee skills.  
   - **Cosine Similarity** is used to measure how well a task matches an employee’s skill set.  
   - Ensures **workload balancing** so no one is overloaded.  

3. **Displays AI-Generated Task Assignments** 📊  
   - A **table** lists who gets assigned which tasks.  
   - A **graph** visualizes match scores and workload distribution.  

4. **Allows Manual Adjustments** ✏  
   - Users can **reassign tasks** if needed.  
   - AI **suggests alternate employees** for each task based on match scores.  

5. **Stores & Syncs Data in Real-Time** 🔄  
   - Uses **Firebase** to store task assignments.  
   - Team members can use a **real-time chat feature** to discuss changes.  

6. **Users Can Download Final Task Assignments** 📥  
   - Generates a **CSV report** with all assigned tasks.
